I choose to compare the selected data against overall average scenario
There are three alternative designs that would allow this comparison
1. Show two comparisons on the same graph, with two bars belonging to the same prio be ajacent to each other
   and distinct the two bars in the same prio with different color
2. Show two comparisons on the same graph, with two bars beloning to the same prio overlap each other( same x location)
   and to distinct the two bars in the same prio with different color and opacity, and use color to differentiate if it
   is over the average or below the average, for example, if it is over the average show the difference with red, and show
   the difference below average with blue   
3. Show two comparisons at two different graphs side by side
